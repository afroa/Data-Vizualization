            <p>One possible explanation for this downward trend in customer complaints may be due in part to increased scrutiny on Navient as lawsuits made their way through the courts.

            <br>
            <br> <strong><a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/" target="_blank">Student Loan Planner,</a></strong> an online service which aids students seeking private education loans by connecting them to lenders, offered that the low-cost contract used by the government to service millions of borrowers may have translated into low pay for service representatives and, in turn, into "poor customer service and frequent incompetence." 
            <br>
            <br>
            The data as reported by the <strong><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=line&dateInterval=Month&dateRange=3y&date_received_max=2021-11-14&date_received_min=2018-11-14&expandedRows=Student%20loan&issue=Dealing%20with%20your%20lender%20or%20servicerâ€¢Received%20bad%20information%20about%20your%20loan&lens=Overview&product=Student%20loan&searchField=company&searchText=Navient%20Solutions%2C%20LLC.&tab=Trends" target="_blank">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a></strong> found that federal loans had more complaints than private loans, and that the highest complaining states were California, Florida, Texas, and New York.
          <br>
          <br>
          Student Loan Planner states that students with Navient accounts should not panic, that "there's a good chance that Navient is servicing your loan exactly as it should." They recommend contacting Navient immediately if there are any problems, and that its possible Navient will act swiftly given the "bad PR" the company has received in recent years.
